# Changelog

All notable changes to Tracekeeper will be documented in this file.

## [0.1.0] - Initial Private Build

### Added

- Obsidian plugin scaffold for Agent Activity, Review Queue, audit, permissions, runtime status, and AI tool connections.
- MCP server with read-only tools, bounded working-record writes, and review-gated approved writeback.
- Shared TypeScript core package for vault scanning, recall, context packs, source analysis, lint, and safety helpers.
- Root workspace verification through `npm run verify`.

### Changed

- Product name, plugin display name, MCP config key, and repository name are aligned as Tracekeeper / `tracekeeper` / `obsidian-tracekeeper`.
- User-facing connection settings no longer assume a fixed vault path, repository path, local port, or developer machine path.
- README, manifest description, and community submission notes are prepared for public community plugin review.

### Security

- MCP Runtime now requires a generated local token by default.
- Standalone missing-token startup is limited to an explicit development flag.
- HTTP Runtime CORS no longer uses wildcard origins and is limited to Obsidian or loopback origins.
